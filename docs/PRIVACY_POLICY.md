# Privacy Policy for CleanBrowse

**Last Updated:** [Date]

Welcome to CleanBrowse ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data in the CleanBrowse Chrome extension.

## 1. Data We Do Not Collect

We believe in privacy by design. CleanBrowse is built to be a privacy-first application, which means we **do not** collect, store, or transmit any of your personal information or browsing data. Specifically, we do not collect:

- Your browsing history, URLs, or search queries.
- Any data you enter into web forms.
- Your IP address or location information.
- Any information that could be used to personally identify you.

## 2. Data We Collect (Only for Premium Subscribers)

If you choose to purchase a CleanBrowse Premium subscription, we collect a minimal amount of information required to process your payment and manage your license. This includes:

- **Email Address:** We collect your email address during the checkout process to send you your license key and communicate important account-related information.
- **Payment Information:** All payments are processed by our third-party payment provider, Stripe. We do not store your credit card details on our servers. We only receive a confirmation of your payment and subscription status from Stripe.
- **License Key:** We generate and store a license key associated with your subscription to validate your premium status.

## 3. How We Use Your Data

The limited data we collect from premium subscribers is used solely for the following purposes:

- To process your payment and activate your premium subscription.
- To verify the status of your license key.
- To send you important updates about your subscription or the CleanBrowse extension.
- To respond to your support inquiries.

## 4. Permissions

CleanBrowse requests a minimal set of permissions to function correctly. Here’s why we need each one:

- **`declarativeNetRequest`:** This is the core permission that allows us to block ads and trackers efficiently without accessing your browsing data.
- **`storage`:** We use this to store your settings, whitelisted sites, and license key locally on your device.
- **`activeTab`:** This permission allows you to interact with the extension's popup and manage settings for the currently active tab.
- **`scripting`:** Used for cosmetic filtering and advanced features like "Stealth Mode".

## 5. Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the limited information we collect. All communication with our backend services is encrypted using HTTPS.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new policy on this page and, if you are a premium subscriber, by sending an email to you.
